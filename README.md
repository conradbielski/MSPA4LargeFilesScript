# MSPA4LargeFilesScript
BASH script used to cut large image inputs into manageable pieces that can be processed with the GUIDOS Toolbox.

## Background
This script was produced as part of a contract with the European Environment Agency ([EEA](http://www.eea.europa.eu/)) and [Terranea](http://www.terranea.de/), [EOXPLORE](http://www.eoxplore.com/), and Dr. K. Ostapowicz to produce the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) output based on the Copernicus High Resolution Layer (HRL) [Forests](http://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-layers/forests) product. The MSPA is computed using the [GuidosToolbox](http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/download/software/guidos/).
